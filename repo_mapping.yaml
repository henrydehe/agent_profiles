# Repository to Profile Mapping
# Maps each target repository to its assigned profile

repositories:
  # Example entries - replace with actual repos and profiles
  # "org/repo-name":
  #   profile: "profile_name"
  #   agent_files:
  #     claude: "CLAUDE.md"
  #     codex: "agents.md"  
  #     positron: "llms.txt"
  #   path: "."  # Where to place the files in the target repo
  
  # Template for new entries:
  # "your-org/your-repo":
  #   profile: "economic_models"  # Must match a file in profiles/ (without .md)
  #   agent_files:
  #     claude: "CLAUDE.md"
  #     codex: "agents.md"
  #     positron: "llms.txt"
